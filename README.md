## Description

This is a class assignment that required us to make a timed quiz that stores the Top 10 high scores in localStorage.  It has the following acceptance criteria:

- WHEN I click the start button, THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question, THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly, THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over, THEN I can save my initials and score

### Easter Eggs

Note: Some questions contain easter eggs and may change the location of a correct answer or how the user interacts with the quiz.  These are not bugs and should be a fun way to add some interactivity to the game.
