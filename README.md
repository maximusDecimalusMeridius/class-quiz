# class-quiz

## Description

This is a class assignment that required us to make a timed quiz that stores high scores in localStorage.  It has the following acceptance criteria:

-WHEN I click the start button, THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
-WHEN I answer a question, THEN I am presented with another question
-WHEN I answer a question incorrectly, THEN time is subtracted from the clock
-WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, THEN the game is over
-WHEN the game is over, THEN I can save my initials and score

## Edge Cases Tested

-New user visits page for the first time
-User plays the game, then actively deletes localStorage var, starting a new game before reloading or visiting again
